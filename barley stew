1/2 lb gr beef
1/2 c chopped onion
1/4 c chopped celery
18 oz can tomato juice
1/4 c uncooked barley
1/2 c water
1 tsp salt
1 tsp chili powder
1/4 tsp pepper

In a 3 quart saucepan, cook and stir meat and onion; drain.  Stir in
the rest of the ingredients.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat; cover and
simmer until barley is done and stew is thickened - about 1 hour.

For example - if your tomato juice can is 36 ounce, then double the
rest of the ingredients.  These amounts are estimations.  You can add
more beef or onion or celery, or juice, just don't add too much more
barley.  You can freeze the leftovers.
