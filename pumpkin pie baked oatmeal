Ingredients
1 (15 oz.) can pumpkin purée
½ cup brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
½ tsp salt
¾ tsp baking powder
½ tsp vanilla extract
1½ cups milk
2½ cups dry old-fashioned oats

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin
purée, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, salt, and baking powder
until smooth. Whisk in the milk (and yogurt if using).

Mix the dry oats into the pumpkin mixture. Coat an 8×8 (or similar sized)
baking dish with non-stick spray. Pour in the pumpkin oat mixture. Cover with
foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, removing the foil after the
first 30 minutes.

Serve hot right out of the oven or refrigerate until ready to serve. Can be
eaten cold or reheated. Top with milk, maple syrup, whipped cream, or nuts.
