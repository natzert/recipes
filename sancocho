This recipe comes from a very kind fellow redditor, apostrophie, who has been
sending me delicious Columbian recipes. We had our first overcast day in months
so I decided to give this stew a try. I made it with a mix of oxtail and short
ribs.

From Wikipedia..."The Sancocho is a traditional plate in Colombia. Sancocho is
made with almost any kind of meat most commonly chicken, gallina (hen), fish,
and ox tail, along with large pieces of plantain, potato, yuca (cassava) and/or
other vegetables such as tomatoe, scallions, cilantro, and mazorca (corn on the
cob) depending on the region. "

For the stew...

Oxtails

Short ribs

Olive oil

Onion

Garlic

Cilantro

Beef broth

Tomato paste

Yuca (cassava)

Plantains, green and yellow

Carrots

Corn on the cob

Salt

Pepper

For the garnish...

Banana

Avocado

Cilantro

Juice of lime

Salt the meat and brown it in batches in olive oil. When all of the meat has
browned recombine and add sliced onion.

Cook for a few minutes then add garlic and cilantro and cook a few more
minutes. You don't want the garlic to burn. Add enough beef broth to cover the
meat. Bring to a simmer and add a few tablespoons of tomato paste. Simmer until
the meat is tender...it will be a couple of hours.

Remove the meat from the pot, let cool, and remove the bones. While the meat is
cooling you can start adding the veggies to the pot. Add the meat back in and
cook until the veggies are tender...around 30 minutes.

Ladle into bowls and top with a fresh squeeze of lime juice, fresh cilantro,
avocado, and banana.
