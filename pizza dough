makes one thick 14" pie or, if you stretch it well enough, two very thin 14"
pies. i prefer to do it thin.

2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 1/2 cups warm water
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 1/2-4 1/2 cups flour

Dissolve yeast, brown sugar in warm water; allow to sit for 10 minutes.

Stir in salt and olive oil.

Mix in 3 cups of flour or enough to form a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a
well floured surface and knead in more flour until dough is barely sticky to
the touch.

Place dough into a oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap.

Let dough rise until doubled (bout an hour), punch down and form into a tight
ball. Allow dough to relax for 5 minutes prior to stretching and rolling into
desired shapes.

Brush lightly with olive oil, pierce with a fork all over dough and par bake
crust at 425 for 5 minutes.

Add desired toppings and bake for approximately 10 minutes or until desired
level of doness is reached.

Allow to cool for 4-5 minutes prior to cutting to allow cheese to set.
