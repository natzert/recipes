Soup
2 cloves garlic $0.16
1 medium yellow onion $0.57
3 ribs celery $0.80
½ lb (3-4) carrots $0.55
1 large (3/4 lb.) chicken breast $1.49*
1 whole bay leaf $0.15
1 tsp dried basil $0.10
1 tsp dried thyme $0.10
freshly cracked pepper $0.05
4 cups water $0.00
1 tsp salt (plus more to taste) $0.05

Dumplings
1½ cups all-purpose flour $0.21
1½ tsp baking powder $0.15
½ tsp salt $0.02
½ Tbsp dried parsley $0.15
6 Tbsp cold butter $0.90
¾ tsp sugar $0.01
⅔ cup milk $0.41

1. Mince the garlic, dice the onion, and slice the carrots and celery into
small pieces. Add the garlic, onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, basil, thyme,
chicken breast, water, and some freshly cracked pepper to a slow cooker. Stir
to combine and then cook on high for four hours or low for eight hours.

2. After cooking for four hours on high or eight hours on low, remove the
chicken from the broth and place it on a cutting board (if you cooked on low
heat, turn it to high now). Use two forks to shred the chicken. Return the
chicken to the pot and stir in 1 tsp of salt to the soup. Keep the slow cooker
covered as much as possible during this process to retain heat and maintain the
temperature.

3. Allow the soup to continue to cook on high while you mix the dumpling
batter. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, parsley, and
sugar. Mix well. Add butter in small chunks and cut it in or work it in with
your hands until the mixture resembles damp sand. Add the milk and stir until a
very soft paste-like mixture forms.

4. Remove the lid from the slow cooker and drop the dumpling batter into the
soup by the heaping spoonful. Return the lid to the slow cooker and allow the
dumplings to steam for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes they should have fluffed
and expanded from the heat. Although they may look moist on the outside, they
will be light and fluffy on the inside. Serve hot.
